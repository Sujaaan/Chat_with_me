# Chat App

Hey there,I am Sujan S, 4th year in NITK of the Computer Science Department.
In this project I have made a fully deployed  chatting app for texting using using Flutter for front end and Firebase for backend.
One could even say this is a much simpler version of facebooks messenger. 

Instructions to use the app:
Go to the build folder-->App-->outputs-->Flutter-apk-->app-debug.apk .
Install this apk in your android phone and use it. Register with any dummy mail and enjoy texting your friends.

NOTE: Connect your phone instead of a emulator for better performance.
      The IOS version is still in build and thus no mode of installing for ios right now. It will soon be added the the same repo. 
      However you can still run the main.dart file in an emulator if you want to see it run on IOS.
